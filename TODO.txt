BUGS
====
Can't use ExceptionNotifier without ActionMailer.


TODO
====
Use formtastic plugin.
Figure out how to include my jQuery extensions, while keeping them in a separate repository.
Test/refactor my custom RSpec stuff.
Pull in my CRUD controller.
    Use less before/after filters, pulling that stuff into the crud_actionname methods, which the actionname methods will call.
    Put the scaffold/crud/resource generator in here?
Pull in my generic views.
Flesh out generators; use Shoulda and RSpec 'it' syntax.
    Name the generator "crud_resource", have it do model, controller, route.
        Also "crud_controller" (no model), "model", "route".
Manual testing.
  cd testsite
  ./script/generate rspec_scaffold thing name:string age:integer admin:boolean
  rake db:migrate
  ./script/server
  browse to http://localhost:3000/things
Pull in BaseHTML stuff.
  HTML fragments
    Tables
    Forms
  CSS fragment
    Tables
    Forms
Figure out what to do about GEM version numbers.
  Should we be using git submodules, and pulling straight from github?
      I'd rather use shared system GEMs, in most cases.
Make sure we have a favicon (both that we defined in application layout) and robots.txt.
  Make sure app will run "out of the box" without errors or missing files.
Need to be able to specify GEMs that are only needed for development, not deployment.
  Will :lib => false work?
Add more plugins:
  AuthLogic, Clearance, RPX (leaning towards this -- outsource authentication to an external source)
  Automated validations, pulled from DB (DrySQL, Magic???, validation_reflection (valirefl), ???)
  Annotate-models, ColumnComments, or my own annotation/labeling system. (Only if AR is enabled.)
  Auto-migrations?
  Machinist (fork that handles DM) instead of FactoryGirl (which already handles DataMapper, as long as you require dm-validations)?
  jRails (maybe, or just use hand-written jQuery) - probably include it just in case.
  Allow SVN instead of GIT. (Still pull from GIT, but use SVN after that.)
jQuery functionality
  Validation.
      How do we tell the view to add required and data-type attributes to INPUT elements?
  Column sorting.
  Pagination.
  Autogrow TEXTAREAs.
Add custom generator for Blue Ridge javascript_specs.
    What's wrong with the ones that come with Blue Ridge?
        I probably wanted to include more default functionality -- just not sure what I could add that would be pertinent for all tests.
        Might want to add jQuery.
More rake tasks.
    git:pre_commit
    spec:javascripts - blue-ridge says it adds it, but only adds test:javascripts
    jquery:download
    jquery:update
    css:compress (asset:packager:build_all should cover this)
    javascript:compress (asset:packager:build_all should cover this)
